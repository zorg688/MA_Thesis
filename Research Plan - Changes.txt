Old plan:

Get teacher model scores

for each teacher model:
	- get 5 student models for transformer size
	- get 5 student models for transformer tiny size
	- get student model scores
	- compare student model scores
		- get standard deviation for transformer size distribution
		- get standard deviation for transformer-tiny size distribution
		- check if standard deviation is bigger or smaller
			- if bigger -> less robust
			- if smaller -> more robust
	
for each dataset:
	- get 5 baseline models for transformer size
	- get 5 baseline models for transformer-tiny size
	- compare performance to student models
		- same as different model sizes

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

New Plan:

- get teacher model scores
	- check predictions for obvious errors and issues

- get student model scores for transformer and tiny sizes
	- compare individual scores to teachers and also mean performance to check for regularity
		- if all performances better: KD is useful
		- if not all performances are better: depends on the errors
		- if none are better: sequence based KD not useful for language normalization of code-mixed languages
	- check predictions for obvious errors and issues compared to teacher models

- get baseline model scores
	- compare individual scores to teachers and students and also mean performance to check for regularities
		- if scores are better than student models: 
	- check predictions for obvious errors and issues compared to teacher and student models
