Process: 
- create machine translated data
- Find multilingual Opus model(s) that perform well for translation tasks
- test performance change when using  code switched data vs not code-switched
- test performance change when using machine translated data
- choose 1-2 best models/ most robust models
- perform systematic knowledge distillation processes
- analyse performance and log performance development for different knowledge distillation processes and try to find a regularity
- check which model is more robust and whether this has any effect 
- write thesis
